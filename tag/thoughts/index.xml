      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lockdown has to got to be the most interesting time of our lives. Atleast for me I never
imagined living this way, it has always been a dream of mine to buy a huge area of land
close to a river and just pass my days in the arms of nature doing life&amp;rsquo;s basic chores but never
thought this would come to life ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
